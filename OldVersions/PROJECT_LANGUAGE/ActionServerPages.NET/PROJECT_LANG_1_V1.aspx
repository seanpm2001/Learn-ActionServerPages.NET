<!-- Project language file 1
For: seanpm2001/Learn-ActionServerPages.NET
About:
I decided to make ActionServerPages.NET (Action Server Pages DOT NET Core) the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-ActionServerPages.NET) as ASP.NET (Core) is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the ASP.NET Core programming language. It only makes sense to ASP.NET core the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
